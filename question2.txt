The referenced warning means that a Vue property was present in the HTML when
the page was rendered but not set within the Vue data. In this specific
situation, it's technically safe to ignore it as it won't derail the execution
of your code or the rendering of the page, but it won't function as intended
since Vue won't be able to access it. It can be fixed by ensuring that your
Vue code contains a definition for the property and that the property is
present within the app's return statement.
